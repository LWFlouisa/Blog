title: How My Work Differs From Cyberpunk
published: true

If I could summarize the main difference between Cyberpunk, and my work:

-- Neither Europe or Japan are cultural hegimons, but rather split into faction groups between France and Japan. This means that some regions speak French, and their capital punishment method if the guillotine. Regions controlled by Japan decapitate criminals with a Katana or hang them. ( This depends on the class of the criminal. )

-- There is more of a focus on Isolated Communities, and less of a focus on "debranding" per say. Virtual reality as we know it is not as advanced as it is in Cyberpunk. Because of the lack of "debranding", girls are more likely to not just be "punks", but wear Birkenstocks.

-- Artificial Intelligence did not become as Generalized as originally hoped.

-- More of an emphasis on "Magical Realism" than explicit tech.

-- More of a focus on "Ero-Guro" content, than tech focused narratives.

There is one other difference, and that the narratives are primarily romance and not action oriented. The romance is not, however, a HEA or even most of the time HFN. Rather they're stories about breaking up.
