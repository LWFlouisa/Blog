title: My Experience With Comicsgate Harassment

### PART ONE

I came from a slightly different background when it comes to observing the toxic behaviors of Comicsgate. In a lot of ways I consider a more dangerous cult than Billy Meier by virtue on most cis white men having less far to go to accept Comicsgate into their lives than a UFO cult. The racism is already present in a large percentage of the population, though unlike the far left I would never claim people are born “inherently racist”. What I will say is this was the lens I took when observing Comicsgate channels: as someone observing a cult in progress.

As a background, I had survived the Billy Meier cult, when I was deep into the UFO subject, and was considering becoming a UFO researcher and lecturer myself. I still might at some point, though never in the same way that I would have when I was part of UFO culture. But this experience with Billy Meier reminded me of the “exclusive information” mindset, and how leaders of cults think of themselves as being the only ones with access to information.

But the personality cult of Gate communities like Gamergate and Comicsgate is...well different. There isn’t a centralized chain of command like there is for more formal cult groups. And because these people aren’t peddling UFO lore, but rather “marketing information” this is more easily digestible than simply throwing people into some 150 “contact notes”. But that tone of “exclusive information” only accessible to a chosen few is still present.

I had also previously had a run in with Breadtube before I observed Comicsgate, and I found a weird amount of cross over, not in the exact wordings of what they say, so much as the tactics that they use to silence those who disagree with their doctrine. In both cases there is a strong “black vs. white” sense of morality, with those who belong to the group and those who don’t, and those who don’t being seen as the oppressors. You’ll note that despite Comicsgate being the actual oppressors, they’ll make anyone not them look like the oppressor. But why bring up an obscure Far Left youtube network?

Because I feel like my general repulsion of Breadtube “logic” made want somewhat of an escape from Dogmatism, which was unfortunately also present in Comics and Graphic Novel communities on Youtube. If we ever want to solve the division in this country, then we first need to resolve the issue of people falling prey to personality cults on the web, that are not so much different ideologies as they are rival gangs, that have their own “exclusive information” that others outside that group should not have access to.

### PART TWO

While I was undergoing the harassment on my Twitter profile, I went through a lot of the things that Heather Antos and others described. However for some reason when I tried reaching out to people, people in the mainstream comics community were unwilling to help people that were trying to reach out for help. It literally took me blocking people that keep making new accounts just to prevent people from being necessarily angry at me for no other reason than pure bigotry.

The reason I didn’t notice anything unusual, at least initially, was that in general I don’t really use Twitter much anymore, except to sometimes market my web comic and writing. All this changed when I started being stalked on social media by EVS types. They initially presented themselves as being “super fans” of comics, and also my work. I had already known about Comicsgate for some time before that point, but had never experienced it directly do to me rarely using because I find it difficult to concentrate on it.

But now I found that after I stopped being harassed on Twitter, and blocking people that promoted their Indiegogo pages, much of the comics community largely played a deaf ear to the harassment that I was experiences. I had already cut off most of my old friends that were a part of Left Tube, because of their abusive behaviour directed at me as a Trans Woman. I slowly began to fear talking about my issues on the web, mostly because Mastodon itself, as tolerant as they claim to me of LGBT people, were not really there when it counted. Rather than choosing to help me resolve the issue, Mastodon instead opted to suspend my account as if I were a Comicsgate person.

Social media website should have safeguards in place to prevent those harassed by Comicsgate from being further abused by Fediverse moderators. I am personally holding the original creator of Mastodon responsible for this breach of justice. Rather than helping me when I needed it the most, instead he left the Lefties in his community basically harass me needlessly.

My only real comfort is suggesting that others who experienced the issues that I have to not rely on Mastodon for support of Trans Women, and instead using websites marked as Free Speech instances, that have LGBT domain names. I’m not going to mention the specific person in question. And sometimes social media instances shut off new registrations.

### PART THREE

We need to find a way to properly coordinate information about the harassment cult ideologies more generally, but also troll groups like Comicsgate, to prevent people from being in a similar situation that I was in. After all, it’s not nice to have constantly ask for help for resolving a specific issue, by people who claim to be my allies and claim to support trans women.

My only conclusion is that Leftist spaces are not actually as supportive of Trans Women as they claim to be, otherwise how do you explain them being unwilling to help me when I needed it the most?
