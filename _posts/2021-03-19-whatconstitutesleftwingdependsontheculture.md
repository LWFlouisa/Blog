title: What Constitutes Left Wing Depends On The Culture
published: true

This video is based on my own observations about how to me, it's important to take into account the modern change in the political climate on the left, and how what constitutes left-wing is dependant on the culture. For example, when Garo came out, this was considered a left-wing masterpiece. However this book was primarily about lifting up the working-class, with zero relationship to the American conception of Critical Theories.

With the advent of Manga becoming a universal language, modern Gekiga by route of Gekiga 2.0 would need to do something different to set it about from Manga that has grown accustome to the standards created by the original Gekiga movement. This includes increased production of manga outside of Japan, and in the American context a focus on French and Japanese language book for those who first language is not English.

Support for other languages is also supported by me, but my focus will always be on the French and Japanese languages.
