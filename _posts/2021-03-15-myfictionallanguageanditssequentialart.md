title: My Fictional Language And Its Sequential Art
published: true
---
This essay is about the evolution of my fictional language, with its roots in the romance language French, and the East Asian language of Japanese. And how it all ties into my switching priorities as a short story writer and strip script writer. Originally I had wanted to get published as a Mangaka in Japan, however even back then I had more of an interest in fictional languages, and specifically writing systems.

Hafestra can be thought of as a intermediary language for French and Japanese diplomats in the early version, with it being closer to French. However, as those colonized in the united states came from a different socio-political history than either Japan or France, there were changes in the Japanese dialect of French that permitted words that only exist in Native American, and certain dialects in American English that were loaned into the language. The final version of the language is neither Japanese or French, but is essentially its own culture like the Meti of Louisiana and Quebec. There are also differences in the valuing of authoritarian power structures.

Although much of my frustrations with the manga industry came down to inaccessibility to the Japanese market by Gaijin, my work had slowly began to evolve  in a different direction from manga, existing in a mid way point between American comic strips and Japanese manga, and as I write this essay, am researching an extensive amount of medieval French and Japanese history, and exploring ways in which it combines, sort of like how Catholicism integrated into Latin American cultures.

In a sense, because of the Japanese market’s tendency to resist ( until extremely recently ) those outside of Japan from becoming Mangaka, I wanted to create a culture that is equally influenced by French and Japanese art traditions like Nouvelle Manga, in a way unique and completely different from Amerimanga, which some say is the American equivalent to the concept. I disagree, to me the only true Nouvelle Manga for the United States is Nouvelle Manga Americana, French-language manga for American creators. Japan will always hate Gaijin no matter how hard we work at our craft. It’s time that we call the Manga industry out on their bluff, and make our own industry with its own forms and conventions.

Ultimately I seek to create sequential art medium that uses this fictional language rather than French or Japanese, and have its own culture unique to it, and have become the Lingua Franca of the Manga world, rather than something like “silent manga”, which serves more to soft peddle the inherent difference between American manga and Japanese manga, when we have our own needs seperate and distinct from comics or Manga.

I no longer dream of becoming a Mangaka.

I have Esiomi.
