title: Going To Focus On Spending My Money On Webcomic Creators
published: true

I feel like news websites that create headlines like whether Punisher Max should lose his skull symbol, is an example of the general suicidal trajectory it seems like the comic industry is going. For me, it's not even worth the financial risk to spend money on book at publishers that don't even take the time to ask me whether I'm actually for or against Comicsgate on Twitter.

As far as I'm concerned, the rest of the comic industry is Comicsgate Lite, no matter how much they claim to be against Comicsgate. They truth is shown in how they're willing to treat actual trans women--and throw us under the bus when we're no longer useful to them. Rather the comic industry would prefer using our minority status as trans women to enrich themselves, rather than actually be for helping actual trans women fend off against the onslaught of Comicsgate.

They would rather fight on cultural issues, because in comics in the same old shit: top-down management, and people that don't really own the rights to their own creations. What we need are worker-cooperatives, and decentralized business management. Not one publisher that makes a decision on behalf of an entire group of authors, by blocking them on social media.
